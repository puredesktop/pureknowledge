# pureknowledge

**Keep a connected wiki and working notes.** An app for [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai).

[Get started](#getting-started) · [App guide](docs/app-guide.md) · [Develop](docs/development.md) · [Developer account](https://puredesktop.ai/developers)

## What it does

A note and wiki workspace for capturing knowledge, organizing pages, and connecting information to other resources. Use it to maintain a living reference that you and the app’s agent can work with.

## Requirements

Use a compatible [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) build for desktop integration, storage, and the app drawer. Developer setup is covered in the [development guide](docs/development.md).

Create your own spaces and pages. Agent assistance uses the host’s configured agent service.

## Getting started

1. Create a note or page and write the information you want to keep.
2. Organize pages and connect them to relevant resources in the suite.
3. Reopen and update pages as the subject changes; use the app’s navigation to find related material.

## App layout

| Area | What you use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **Sidebar** | Browse and select pages and knowledge resources. |
| **Page editor** | Read and edit the current page’s content. |
| **Page context** | Inspect page metadata and related activity or resources. |
| **Review area** | Inspect activity and recorded agent changes, including their before/after content. |

The app also uses the shared [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) shell and drawer agent. Panels can vary with the current view and selection.

## Working with the agent

Open the app’s drawer in [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) and describe what you want to do. For example:

> Find what we know about this topic.
>
> Check this space for broken links and duplicate pages.

The app exposes 9 tools, including `getKnowledgeContext`, `searchKnowledge`, `readKnowledgePage`. See [agents.md](agents.md) for workflows and [plugin.json](plugin.json) for the complete tool schemas and approval flags. Content writes apply directly and appear in the change log; ask explicitly before destructive merges or deletes.

## Files and data

Pages contain Markdown, tags, aliases, wikilinks, and resource links. The knowledge store is available across the suite; agent changes record summaries and before/after content.

## Develop and customize

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. Fork pureknowledge, add a feature, or use what you learn to build a new app.

| Develop your way | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| **Claude Code, Codex, or your editor** | Open the app’s source folder, read `README.md`, `plugin.json`, `package.json`, and `agents.md`, then make changes and run the app’s checks. Test inside [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai) with matching shared platform packages. |
| **purefactory** | Choose **Start building** for a new app, or select an available app project to extend it. Use **Open folder** for external tools and **Open app** to test. |
| **App drawer** | Request a local app change where app-development integration is available. Make clear whether you want to change the app itself or its current document. |

Use **Share** in purefactory to create a `.pureapp` package, then **Settings → System → Install an app → Choose package…** to load it in current builds. Source availability and integration vary by host build.

Follow the [development guide](docs/development.md) for Claude Code/Codex commands, app-specific setup and checks, and packaging. A standalone browser preview does not provide every desktop service.

## Documentation and limitations

| Guide | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [App guide](docs/app-guide.md) | App overview, source layout, and usage. |
| [Development guide](docs/development.md) | External coding tools, purefactory, checks, and installation. |
| [Agent guide](agents.md) | App-specific agent workflows and constraints. |

Agent writes apply directly and are logged; there is no staging queue. Deleting a page also removes its children, so review the scope of a delete or merge.
