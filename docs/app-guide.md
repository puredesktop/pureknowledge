# pureknowledge app guide

Capture notes, curate wiki pages, and link knowledge to other resources.

## Using the app

1. Create a note or page and write the information you want to keep.
2. Organize pages and connect them to relevant resources in the suite.
3. Reopen and update pages as the subject changes; use the app’s navigation to find related material.

## Development requirements

This app runs within [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai). Its local `@purescience/platform-*` dependencies, desktop bridge, and shared shell come from the parent suite and are not included in this repository. Use the matching suite development environment to install and run it; installing this repository alone is not sufficient for a complete desktop application.

With the shared dependencies available, use the scripts in `package.json` from the app directory:

```sh
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

`dev` starts the development entry point; `build` prepares the app bundle. Tests and type checking require the same shared dependencies as the app. Host services such as file access and connected accounts must be provided by the suite.

## Contributing

Anyone may modify and share this app under its applicable licenses. We welcome pull requests, bug reports, and documentation improvements. See [contribution guidance](../CONTRIBUTING.md), [the license](../LICENSE), and [third-party notices](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
