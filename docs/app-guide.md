# pureknowledge app guide

A note and wiki workspace for capturing knowledge, organizing pages, and connecting information to other resources. Use it to maintain a living reference that you and the app’s agent can work with.

## Workspace layout

| Area | What you use it for |
| --- | --- |
| **Sidebar** | Browse and select pages and knowledge resources. |
| **Page editor** | Read and edit the current page’s content. |
| **Page context** | Inspect page metadata and related activity or resources. |
| **Review area** | Review proposed content changes before incorporating them into your knowledge. |

## Working with pureknowledge

1. Create a note or page and write the information you want to keep.
2. Organize pages and connect them to relevant resources in the suite.
3. Reopen and update pages as the subject changes; use the app’s navigation to find related material.

## Development and loading

We welcome **developers and vibecoders alike**. [Create a developer account on puredesktop.ai](https://puredesktop.ai/developers), then use Claude Code, Codex, your own editor, or purefactory to develop this app or create a new one.

The [development guide](development.md) covers preparing this repository's shared dependencies, starting a coding agent, adding features in purefactory, and checking the result in the desktop. It includes the commands available in this repository.

Use **Open folder** in purefactory to edit a project externally, and **Open app** to test it. Use **Share** to create a `.pureapp` package, then **Settings → System → Install an app → Choose package…** in current builds to install it. Older versions may provide **File → Install App…**. A development server URL alone does not install an app.

To extend this app in purefactory, select its editable project when available. Source development builds can expose the suite's own apps; packaged installations do not expose every built-in app's source. See [create or extend an app](development.md#create-or-extend-an-app-with-purefactory) for that distinction and the app drawer workflow.
